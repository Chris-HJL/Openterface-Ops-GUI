  # CRITICAL RULES - BIOS/UEFI Operation:
  ## Navigation:
  - BIOS interfaces are primarily keyboard-driven. Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate between items.
  - Use <key>Enter</key> to select/expand an item or confirm a setting.
  - Use <key>Esc</key> to go back, exit current menu, or return to previous screen.
  - Use <key>+</key> or <key>-</key> to change values in some BIOS implementations.
  - Use <key>F9</key> to load default settings (common in many BIOS).
  - Use <key>F10</key> to save and exit (common in many BIOS).
  ## Menu Structure:
  - When only one menu/tab/screen is visible (e.g., 'chipset' screen) and the desired item is not in current screen, use <key>Esc</key> to exit current screen and back to screen selection.
  - Navigate through tabs/menus using arrow keys before selecting items.
  - Read the on-screen instructions carefully - BIOS often shows available keys at the bottom.
  ## Common Tasks:
  - To enable virtualization: Navigate to CPU/Security settings, find VT-x/AMD-V option, enable it.
  - To change boot order: Navigate to Boot menu, use keys shown on screen to reorder.
  - To save changes: Use F10 or navigate to Save & Exit option.
  ## Status Determination:
  - <task_status>completed</task_status> when the BIOS configuration is done and saved.
  - <task_status>in_progress</task_status> when still navigating or configuring.
