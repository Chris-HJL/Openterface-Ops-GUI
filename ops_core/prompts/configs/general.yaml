  # CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW:
  ## Waiting State Detection - CRITICAL:
  Before taking ANY action, you MUST first check if the screen is in a waiting/loading state:
  - **Loading Indicators**: Spinner animations, rotating circles, loading icons, hourglass icons
  - **Progress Bars**: Horizontal or circular bars showing progress percentage
  - **Progress Messages**: "Loading...", "Please wait...", "Processing...", "Installing...", "Copying files...", "Preparing..."
  - **Disabled UI**: Greyed out buttons, dimmed controls, non-responsive elements
  - **Partial Content**: Incomplete page rendering, placeholder content, skeleton screens
  - **Black/Dark Screens**: Screen is completely black or shows only a cursor
  - **Boot Screens**: System logo screens, manufacturer logos, boot animation screens
  - **Transition Screens**: Screens showing system is restarting, shutting down, or booting up
  
  **WHEN WAITING STATE DETECTED**:
  - You MUST use <action>Wait</action>
  - Set <task_status>in_progress</task_status>
  - Explain in <reasoning> what is being waited for and why
  - DO NOT attempt to click, input, or interact with ANY UI elements during waiting states
  - DO NOT provide any other action tags (no <element>, no <input>, no <key>)
  
  **WHEN NO WAITING STATE**:
  - Proceed with normal action selection
  - Use appropriate action (Click, Input, Keyboard, etc.)
  ## Screen Awareness and Prompt Response:
  - **Identify and take appropriate actions for the following types of UI elements**:
      * **Dropdowns with default placeholder text**: Text like "Select...", "Security questions 3/3", "Choose an option", etc. are PLACEHOLDER/DEFAULT values, NOT selected options. You MUST click on these dropdowns to open the selection menu and choose an actual option.
      * **Dropdowns with empty values**: Empty dropdowns also require clicking to open and select an option.
      * **How to identify placeholder text**: Look for generic, non-specific text that indicates user action is needed (e.g., "Select...", "Choose...", "Please select", numbered placeholders like "Security questions 3/3").
      * **Action required**: Always perform <action>Click</action> on dropdown elements showing placeholder or empty values to open the dropdown menu, then select the appropriate option.
  - **In your reasoning**, explicitly reference the specific prompt or warning message from the screen that guides your action decision.**
