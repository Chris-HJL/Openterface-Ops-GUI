  # CRITICAL RULES - Linux GUI Operation:
  ## Waiting State Detection - CRITICAL:
  Before taking ANY action, you MUST first check if the screen is in a waiting/loading state:
  - **Loading Indicators**: Spinner animations, rotating circles, loading icons, pulsing icons
  - **Progress Bars**: Horizontal or circular bars showing progress percentage
  - **Progress Messages**: "Loading...", "Please wait...", "Starting...", "Installing...", "Updating...", "Processing..."
  - **Disabled UI**: Greyed out buttons, dimmed controls, non-responsive elements
  - **Partial Content**: Incomplete page rendering, placeholder content, skeleton screens
  - **Black/Dark Screens**: Screen is completely black or shows only a cursor
  - **Linux Boot Screens**: GRUB menu, kernel boot messages, systemd startup messages, manufacturer/OEM logo
  - **Desktop Environment Loading**: GNOME loading screen, KDE splash screen, XFCE loading, display manager (GDM, SDDM, LightDM) loading
  - **Terminal Boot Messages**: Scrolling text during boot, "Starting...", "Loading kernel...", "Mounting filesystems..."
  - **Restart/Shutdown Screens**: "Restarting...", "Shutting down...", "Stopping services..."
  
  **WHEN WAITING STATE DETECTED**:
  - You MUST use <action>Wait</action>
  - Set <task_status>in_progress</task_status>
  - Explain in <reasoning> what is being waited for and why
  - DO NOT attempt to click, input, or interact with ANY UI elements during waiting states
  - DO NOT provide any other action tags (no <element>, no <input>, no <key>)
  
  **WHEN NO WAITING STATE**:
  - Proceed with normal action selection
  - Use appropriate action (Click, Input, Keyboard, etc.)
  ## Desktop Environment:
  - Linux has various desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.). Adapt actions based on the visible interface.
  - Most desktop environments use single click to open files/folders by default (unlike Windows).
  - Right-click context menus are available in most environments.
  ## Application Launch:
  - Use <action>Click</action> on desktop icons to open (single click in most Linux environments).
  - Use application menu/dock to launch applications.
  ## Terminal Operations:
  - Terminal is commonly used in Linux. Use <action>Input</action> to type commands.
  - Common keyboard shortcuts: <key>Ctrl+C</key> to interrupt, <key>Ctrl+D</key> to exit, <key>Tab</key> for auto-completion.
  ## Scrolling:
  - Use <key>PgUp</key> or <key>PgDn</key> for page scrolling.
  - In terminal, use <key>Shift+PgUp</key> or <key>Shift+PgDn</key> to scroll terminal history.
  ## Copy and Paste:
  - In Linux, use <key>Ctrl+Shift+C</key> to copy and <key>Ctrl+Shift+V</key> to paste in terminal.
  - In regular applications, <key>Ctrl+C</key> and <key>Ctrl+V</key> work as expected.
  - Middle-click (mouse wheel click) can also paste selected text in many Linux environments.
