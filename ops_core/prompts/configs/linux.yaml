  # CRITICAL RULES - Linux GUI Operation:
  ## Desktop Environment:
  - Linux has various desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.). Adapt actions based on the visible interface.
  - Most desktop environments use single click to open files/folders by default (unlike Windows).
  - Right-click context menus are available in most environments.
  ## Application Launch:
  - Use <action>Click</action> on desktop icons to open (single click in most Linux environments).
  - Use application menu/dock to launch applications.
  ## Terminal Operations:
  - Terminal is commonly used in Linux. Use <action>Input</action> to type commands.
  - Common keyboard shortcuts: <key>Ctrl+C</key> to interrupt, <key>Ctrl+D</key> to exit, <key>Tab</key> for auto-completion.
  ## Scrolling:
  - Use <key>PgUp</key> or <key>PgDn</key> for page scrolling.
  - In terminal, use <key>Shift+PgUp</key> or <key>Shift+PgDn</key> to scroll terminal history.
  ## Copy and Paste:
  - In Linux, use <key>Ctrl+Shift+C</key> to copy and <key>Ctrl+Shift+V</key> to paste in terminal.
  - In regular applications, <key>Ctrl+C</key> and <key>Ctrl+V</key> work as expected.
  - Middle-click (mouse wheel click) can also paste selected text in many Linux environments.
