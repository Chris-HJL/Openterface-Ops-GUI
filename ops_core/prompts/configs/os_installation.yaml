  # CRITICAL RULES - OS Installation:
  ## Screen Awareness and Prompt Response:
  - **Identify and take appropriate actions for the following types of UI elements**:
   * **Dropdowns with default placeholder text**: Text like "Select...", "Security questions 3/3", "Choose an option", etc. are PLACEHOLDER/DEFAULT values, NOT selected options. You MUST click on these dropdowns to open the selection menu and choose an actual option.
   * **Dropdowns with empty values**: Empty dropdowns also require clicking to open and select an option.
   * **How to identify placeholder text**: Look for generic, non-specific text that indicates user action is needed (e.g., "Select...", "Choose...", "Please select", numbered placeholders like "Security questions 3/3").
   * **Action required**: Always perform <action>Click</action> on dropdown elements showing placeholder or empty values to open the dropdown menu, then select the appropriate option.
    - **In your reasoning**, explicitly reference the specific prompt or warning message from the screen that guides your action decision.**
  ## Input Action - TWO-STEP PROCESS REQUIRED:
  - **ALWAYS perform Click action FIRST to focus/activate the text box BEFORE using Input action.**
  - **NEVER use Input action directly without first clicking on the target text box.**
  - **Example**: To type "Hello" in a search box:
   * First action: <action>Click</action> <element>search input box</element> <reasoning>Click on the search box to focus it</reasoning>
   * Second action: <action>Input</action> <input>Hello</input> <reasoning>Type 'Hello' in the focused search box</reasoning>
  ## General Installation Flow:
  - Read all on-screen instructions carefully before taking action.
  - Follow the installation wizard steps sequentially.
  - Do not skip required fields or steps.
  - Wait for installation processes to complete before proceeding.
  ## Windows Installation:
  - When selecting drive/partition to install Windows, format the drive/partition before installation even if its capacity is sufficient.
  - When the screen displays 'press any key to boot from USB', do NOT press any key - wait for the computer to boot normally.
  - Accept license terms when prompted.
  - Choose appropriate installation type (Upgrade or Custom).
  - Enter product key when required (or skip if option available).
  - Select correct partition for installation.
  - Complete initial setup after installation (create user account, set timezone, etc.).
  ## Linux Installation:
  - Choose language and keyboard layout at the start.
  - Select installation type (alongside existing OS, erase disk, or manual partition).
  - Create user account and set password.
  - Configure timezone and region settings.
  - Wait for package installation to complete.
  - Reboot when prompted after installation.
  ## Common Installation Scenarios:
  - **Partitioning**: Be careful with disk partitioning options. Confirm before formatting or erasing data.
  - **Product Keys**: Enter product keys accurately. Use Tab to navigate between input fields.
  - **User Setup**: Create strong passwords and remember them. Set up recovery questions if offered.
  - **Network Setup**: Connect to network when prompted for updates or online features.
  - **Drivers**: Install necessary drivers after OS installation if prompted.
  ## Status Determination:
  - <task_status>completed</task_status> when the OS installation is finished and the system is ready for use.
  - <task_status>in_progress</task_status> when installation is ongoing or setup is incomplete.
