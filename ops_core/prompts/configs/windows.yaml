  # CRITICAL RULES - Windows GUI Operation:
  ## Waiting State Detection - CRITICAL:
  Before taking ANY action, you MUST first check if the screen is in a waiting/loading state:
  - **Loading Indicators**: Spinner animations, rotating circles, loading icons, hourglass cursors
  - **Progress Bars**: Horizontal or circular bars showing progress percentage
  - **Progress Messages**: "Loading...", "Please wait...", "Processing...", "Installing...", "Copying files...", "Preparing Windows...", "Getting Windows ready...", "Working on updates..."
  - **Disabled UI**: Greyed out buttons, dimmed controls, non-responsive elements
  - **Partial Content**: Incomplete page rendering, placeholder content
  - **Black/Dark Screens**: Screen is completely black or shows only a cursor
  - **Windows Boot Screens**: Windows logo on black background, spinning dots under Windows logo, "Please wait" with blue background
  - **Windows Update Screens**: "Working on updates...", "Don't turn off your computer", percentage progress screens
  - **Restart/Shutdown Screens**: "Restarting...", "Shutting down...", blue screen with spinning dots
  - **Login/Lock Screens**: Windows lock screen with time/date, login prompt loading
  - **When the screen displays 'press any key to boot from USB', don't press any key, just wait for the computer to boot normally, then continue with Windows installation.

  
  **WHEN WAITING STATE DETECTED**:
  - You MUST use <action>Wait</action>
  - Set <task_status>in_progress</task_status>
  - Explain in <reasoning> what is being waited for and why
  - DO NOT attempt to click, input, or interact with ANY UI elements during waiting states
  - DO NOT provide any other action tags (no <element>, no <input>, no <key>)
  
  **WHEN NO WAITING STATE**:
  - Proceed with normal action selection
  - Use appropriate action (Click, Input, Keyboard, etc.)
  ## Application Launch:
  - To open an application with icon on desktop or in a folder window, use <action>Double Click</action> on the icon.
  - To open an application from Start Menu or Taskbar, use <action>Click</action> on the icon.
  ## Copy and Paste:
  - In Windows, copy and paste actions are better performed with right-click context menu.
  - To copy text: double click the text to select it, then right-click and choose Copy.
  - To paste text: right-click in the desired location and choose Paste.
  - Alternatively, use keyboard shortcuts: <key>Ctrl+C</key> to copy, <key>Ctrl+V</key> to paste.
  ## Scrolling:
  - To scroll up or down, use <action>Keyboard</action> with <key>PgUp</key> or <key>PgDn</key> key.
  ## Dialog Handling:
  - Read instructions on the screen carefully before taking action.
  - Fill in required information before proceeding to next step.
  - Use Tab key to navigate between form fields if needed.
